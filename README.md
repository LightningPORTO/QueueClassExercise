# Multi-threaded element queue in C++

This repository has been created to answer an exercise requested by Bosch. The exercise is detailed [here](Offline-Exercise-Queue_v2.pdf).

I consider that the main goal of the exercise has been reached as I have developed:

- The Queue class with the given interface;
- A main file to serve as an example implementation;
- Unit tests using GoogleTest framework;
- A CMake file to ease the build process.


## Folder structure
In this repo you will find the following folder structure:

```
ðŸ“¦ 
â”œâ”€Â include
â”‚Â Â â””â”€Â problem_queue.hpp (The core file of the exercise, containing the Queue Class)
â”œâ”€Â src
â”‚Â Â â””â”€Â  main.cpp (The main file that will implement the test case of the exercise)
â”œâ”€Â tests
â”‚Â Â â””â”€Â main_tests.cpp (File to run unit tests using Google Test)
â”œâ”€Â .gitignore
â”œâ”€Â CMakeLists.txt
â”œâ”€Â Offline-Exercise-Queue_v2.pdf
â””â”€Â README.md
```

## How to run

1) Clone this repository and move inside the root folder
2) Create a build folder and move inside it
```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
```
3) Configure the CMake
```
$ cmake ..
```
4) Build the project
```
$ cmake --build .
```
5) To run the Unit tests, move inside the build folder and:
```
$ ctest
```

## Known problems
- The extra : "The reading/writing threads should optionally block for a certain period of time. If the
action is successful within this time, true is returned, otherwise false." - Has not been implemented as it would have required changes on the given class interface. However, only slight changes are required to implement this functionality. Preferably using `wait_for` method from `std::condition_variable`.
